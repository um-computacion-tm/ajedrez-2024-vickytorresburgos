**Description** 

This project is an implementation of the chess game using Python, executable via Docker. Some traditional rules of the game have been modified, which are described below.

**Game Rules**

Chess is a strategy game for two players, played on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Each player controls 16 pieces with the objective of capturing the opponent's king. The winner is determined by who captures the enemy king first or by a draw agreed upon by both players.

**Piece Movement:**

    - Pawn: Moves one square forward but captures diagonally. Can move two squares forward on its first move.
    - Rook: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
    - Knight: Moves in an "L" shape, two squares in one direction and one perpendicular.
    - Bishop: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
    - Queen: Combines the movements of the rook and the bishop.
    - King: Moves one square in any direction.
